#### Hypervisor
- A hypervisor is a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine. 
- Every virtual machine has its own operating system and applications. 
- The hypervisor allocates the underlying physical computing resources such as CPU and memory to individual virtual machines as required.

#### Virtualization
-   Virtualization is a technology that enables the creation of virtual instances of computer hardware, software, storage devices, and network resources. 
- These virtual instances, known as virtual machines (VMs) or virtual environments, operate independently from the physical hardware, allowing multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical machine simultaneously.



#### Key benefits of Docker
1. **Consistency**: Containers ensure that an application behaves consistently across different environments, reducing the chances of issues arising due to differences in the underlying infrastructure.
    
2. **Isolation**: Containers provide isolation for applications, allowing them to run independently without interfering with each other or the host system.
    
3. **Portability**: Docker containers can be easily moved and deployed across different platforms and environments, making it easier to build, test, and deploy applications.
    
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight and share the host system's kernel, resulting in lower overhead compared to traditional virtual machines.
